Grace is acceptance of the unmerited reality that God has given us everything and we've done nothing to deserve it. There is nothing that you can do that will make God love you any more, nor is there anything you can do that will make God love you any less.

It's important to accept grace, or you don't really have it. But you can definitely extend grace to other people, and they can choose to either accept it or not. It's a two way interaction.
